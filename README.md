My personal emacs starter kit / emacs configuration.

Credits and references
======================

I am not a lisp wizard.  Therefore, this is a collection of several
modes, tweaks, customizations and tweaks that I have read here and
there. Mostly I put here those cool features that I found on other
emacs starter kits or customizations. The main sources are
[Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude),
[spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) and
[emacsrocks](http://emacsrocks.com/).  There are probably other
references and maybe some code from some friends, such as
[juliocc](https://github.com/juliocc).
